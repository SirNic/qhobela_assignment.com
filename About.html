I spent the whole of school life there. I went to primary at Mafube English Medium, where i did my standard 1 to 7 in the years 2008 to 2014 and managed to attain a top 4 rank for my PSLE certificate.I furthered my studies at St.Boniface High School to do my JC and LGCSE, and managed to pass them with really convicing grades.In 2020,I moved on to Lesotho High School to do my Advanced Subsidiary so I can upgrade my grade standards so I can study abroad, in the process of studying COVID-19 happened and my dream of studying abroad seemed impossible. Once I was done with AS LEVEL, I applied to Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, where I am currently studying BSc in Software Engineering with Multimedia.</p>
