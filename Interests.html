			<h1>My Interests</h1>
			<p><img src="IMAGES/Football-Vs-Basketball.png" width="350" height="200" align="right" />I have several interests. But of all those Cars, Fashion and Sports are top of the list. Let me start with sports. I grew up as a soccer fan, till today. I loved soccer with all heart, I even went as far as being a soccer player, I participated in matches back in high school, playing as a winger until I experienced severe feet injuries that made me lose my mini-carrer in soccer. My soccer or football journey was inspired by a professional player, Wayne Rooney back in 2009, and his team at time, Manchester United, which has been my favourite team up-to-date,it was under leadership of Sir Alex Ferguson. Currently in my sport world, I am a basketball player, my inspirations are players like Ja Morant because his defense technique, Lamelo Ball because of his ball distribution and Steph Curry due to His accuracy.</p>

My favourite car company is Bayerische Motoren Werke,abbr BMW,FOUNDED in 1916. Of all cars they manufactured, the 1987 BMW 325is E30(2.5-Litre 6-cylinder with 170 horsepower) popularly known as "gusheshe" and BMW M4(twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six, with 550Nm of Torque and 473 horsepower.) are close to my heart.When it comes to fashion I was inspired by my aunt who is a tailor and she made fall inlove with garments.Went on to research about international designers and in the process of finding what fashion really is, I fell for brands like Versace, Gucci and Louis Vuitton which are not so cheap, truth be told.Later on growing up I became a fan of Nike.</p>
